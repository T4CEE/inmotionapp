      "While investing in cryptocurrency, NFTs, and the metaverse may be popular among some younger individuals as a way of building wealth, there is a growing trend among Millennials and members of Generation Z toward investing in real estate.",
    text2:
      "The value of property investment at a young age cannot be overstated, as early investment allows a land property’s value to increase over time, securing wealth in the long term.",
    text3:
      "Interestingly, younger generations have challenged the conventional belief that property ownership is exclusively for the privileged, wealthy, and older generations. They have recognized the benefits of investing in land to secure their financial future.",
    text4:
      " Real estate is now available to everyone, and land banking is a simple way to get started in real estate investment.",
    text5:
      "By definition, land banking is a real estate investment scheme that involves the acquisition of undeveloped land in segments at a reduced rate in regions with economic development potential.",
    text6:
      "This is done to hold the land for a set period to build or sell it for a profit as the land appreciates.",
    text7:
      "The entire concept is akin to playing a real-life game of Monopoly.",
    text8:
      "The objective is to accumulate a substantial plot of land with the ultimate goal of maximizing the return on investment over time. Ideally, the value of the land will increase to the point where selling a single plot can cover a significant portion, if not all, of the initial investment cost.",
    heading1:
      "Here are simple steps to get you started in land banking right away.",
    highlighted1: "1. Find a certified real estate company.",
    text9:
      " Investing in real estate through a trusted company can alleviate the challenges of buying land directly from the community while also offering protection from potential fraudulent activities. Simply make certain the company you’re working with is fully certified and offers terms and pricing that allow for the purchase of land in segments.",
    text10: "In-Motion strongly supports and encourages land banking.",
    highlighted2: "2. Estimate the land’s future economic value.",
    text11:
      "Look for important landmarks with high industrial value in the region, such as proposed refineries, airports, seaports, schools, office buildings, and so on. Consider the road network as well as recent news about large investors in the area.",
    text12:
      "This will inform you of the land’s potential future value in 5–10 years.",
    highlighted3:
      "3. Consider the unique value provided by the real estate company.",
    text13:
      "The unique value alone can be a major economic driver in the region, influencing price action and driving an exponential increase in the value of the land.",
    text14:
      "Watch for the special offers they bring to the real estate market and how they affect the industry.",
    text15:
      "Wana Court, one of the few certified Green and Smart Estates in Nigeria, representing the new era of real estate, has a track record of over 100% increase in land value within one year.",
    highlighted4: "4. Consider the local government’s real estate policies.",
    text16:
      "Don’t be a victim of land grabbing as a result of defaulting the real estate policies. Ensure that it is a sound investment that can be justified.",
    highlighted5: "5. Check the documents.",
    text17:
      "Proper documentation of the land upon acquisition is key; obtain the necessary land documentation from the government authorities and relevant agencies.",
    text18:
      "After the land purchase, In-Motion provides you with the following: a contract of purchase, an invoice of payment, a certificate of land purchase, and a deed of assignment subsequently.",
    highlighted6: "6. Inspect and purchase the land.",
    text19: "Go see the land, in person or virtually, and then buy it.",
    highlighted7: "7. Buy more",
    text20: "It is land banking; own as many plots as you can!",
    text21:
      "You are ready to be a young landlord if you have made it this far. We await your success story.",

      "The value of a real estate property is always subject to appreciation. However, the timeline of its appreciation is determined by certain factors, and these factors inform how soon that property will hit a particular percentage in value.",
    imageUrl: recognise,
    text1: `In real estate purchases, common advice to those seeking to own property is ”don’t buy for the now, buy for the future.” This is because real estate is like wine; it gets better with age.`,
    text2: `The value of a real estate property is always subject to appreciation. However, the timeline of its appreciation is determined by certain factors, and these factors inform how soon that property will hit a particular percentage in value.`,
    text3:
      "If you’re a buyer looking to invest in real estate, and you’re expecting to land-bank it for a set number of years, with the intention of later building or selling it off, then take note of the following hints before you make that step to purchase.",
    text4:
      "Except you’re looking to store up generational wealth for your kids and grand kids, your purchase plan should always carry a duration. If you’re planning to build on a property, you should have an idea of the kind of structures (e.g., residential, commercial, etc.) you’re planning to put up, and by extension, the kinds of structures that should be in the area (by virtue of other owners) when you’re ready to put up yours. If you’re planning to sell after your set time, you should also be able to envision the percentage interest you hope to gain within that time period. This information will help you know the right location to make that purchase.",
    text5:
      "All land is valuable, but not all land goes up in value at the same speed and rate.",
    text6: `Now you must be wondering, 'how do I know the property that will mature in relative accordance with my timeline?’`,
    text7: "We have you covered.",
    text8:
      "If you’re looking at a 5–10 year span, a major way to know a place that will go up in value is by its development.",
    text9:
      "Development comes in a number of ways but tends to follow a pattern. Accessibility is a major indicator of development. When an area is accessible, it becomes more attractive for investments.",
    text10: `Studies have shown that areas where good roads or rails are constructed, have high chances of quick development. This is because accessibility paves the way for economic activity. However, for economic activity to come in, a major flag bearer of development has to come in: transport.`,
    text11: `With the transport industry partnering with good roads, accessibility equals economic activity, and an accessible area with economic activity will see migration and the uprising of business, and with that, a town or city is born.`,
    text12: `Make sense?`,
    text13: `You might be wondering how you can identify the development going on in a place that looks like a bush.`,
    text14: `It's easy`,
    text15: `Follow the news. Read the prevalent reports in those areas. What is the government or a major corporation doing in the environment? By getting this information, you’ll be able to identify areas that will be touched by development.`,
    text16: `For those of you who are looking to land-bank for a longer period of time, the information above applies to you too, and with your plan, you can hold for even longer and accumulate a higher percentage profit.`,
    text17: `Don’t let anyone deceive you, land is a great investment. However, invest wisely.`,

At In-Motion, we are all about making the right choices, and that is why we have provided you with a simple five-point checklist to make sure you’re always taking the right step. A little tip: As you read through, make a mental tick on each point so you never forget it!",
    highlight: "1. LOCATION",
    text2:
      "Even without being told, the location of your property is very important. It is the determinant of how you will relate with that property. Make sure you have a clear idea of what you want or aim to achieve with that property. Even if you don’t know exactly where you want it to be, knowing what you want will make it easier to get, particularly if you’re working with a realtor.",
    highlight2: "2. PROPER DOCUMENTATION",
    text3: "Papers. Papers. Papers.",
    text4:
      "Your proof of purchase are the papers given to you after a purchase. Ensure you’re working with legitimate folks by checking their history with papers. Ask to be shown a sample of what you will receive when you make payment and, if possible, also make the extra effort to check on their legal documents. That’s a pro tip.",
    highlight3: "3. CLOSENESS TO SOCIAL AMENITIES/BENEFITS",
    text5:
      "When getting a property, depending on what you intend to use it for, ensure facilities that will benefit you are in place. For instance, if you’re buying for residential purposes, you need to look out for facilities that make residency easy e.g. shopping centers, parks, etc. Depending on the location and the time frame for the project you hope to actualize, make sure the facilities in the area are, or will be available, beneficial to your plans.",
    highlight4: "4. CLOSENESS TO IDENTIFIABLE AND KNOWN LANDMARKS",
    text6: "Google maps also loses its way, you know!",
    text7:
      "In real estate, it is most profitable to acquire property in a place with promise. This means that the location should have future value even though the present doesn’t look so hopeful. However, some persons make the mistake of overestimating – in the sense that their expectancy timeline does not correlate with feasibility – the future value of a place. In our next post, we will explain how to recognize future value in a location.",
    highlight5: "5. EASY ACCESS | GOOD ROAD NETWORK",
    text8:
      "Property accessibility is key. As much as you want to invest, a property you cannot reach is not an ideal investment. Accessibility builds value feasibility in real estate because, without accessibility, it would take a longer time for development to set in, which would stagnate value progression and possibility of revenue, and this would make the property fall short as a non-operating asset.",
    highlight6: "And that’s it!",
    text9:
      "With the information you’ve mentally ticked, you can be sure that you’d be making informed decisions as you take that step to property ownership. We’ll be providing you with more tips to keep you at the top of your game in the real estate world. Welcome the New Culture!",
